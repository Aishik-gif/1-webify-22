        <h1>Dogs</h1>
        Dogs are sometimes referred to as man's best friend because they are
        kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around
        humans. They are also helpful in reducing stress, anxiety, and
        depression, loneliness, encourage exercise and playfulness and even
        improve your cardiovascular health.

        <h1>Cats</h1>
        Owning a cat can be an extremely rewarding relationship. A cat has the
        ability to both calm your nervous system and provide an immediate outlet
        for fun and play. Although cats are independent animals who like to
        scavenge and explore on their own terms, they are also very affectionate
        with their owners and people they trust.

        <h1>Birds</h1>
        Birds make great first pets because they can be easily integrated into
        households with children and will teach children the responsibility of
        owning an animal.

        <h1>Fishes</h1>
        Keeping fish in an aquarium or pond in your home or garden is a great
        stress-reliever. Fish are known to have a calming effect on those
        watching them and just seeing them glide about the tank is a sure-fire
        way to lower your stress levels and create a more tranquil space in your
        home.
